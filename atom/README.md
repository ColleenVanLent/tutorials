# A tutorial to setup a text editor on your system

####Why use a text editor?
A good text editor is a developer’s best friend. If you are not a developer you will soon be one. So, read on.

Unlike the default Notepad or TextEdit apps on Windows and OS X, coding-specific text editors help developers shortcut common tasks to program applications more quickly, follow web development standards and familiarize yourself with the tools/plugins.

#### Text editor used: [Atom](https://atom.io)

#### What is atom?

Atom is a text editor that's modern, approachable, yet hackable to the core—a tool you can customize to do anything but also use productively without ever touching a config file.

#### Reasons why we selected Atom:
- Easy to setup on all operating systems (Mac, Linux and Windows)
- A ton of easy to install packages
- Good looking themes which complement coding styles
- Endless customization possibilities
- Open Source

## Getting Started
### Documentation

If you want to read about using Atom or developing packages in Atom, the [Atom Flight Manual](https://atom.io/docs/latest/) is free and available online, along with ePub, PDF and mobi versions. You can find the source to the manual in [atom/docs](https://github.com/atom/docs).

The [API reference](https://atom.io/docs/api) for developing packages is also documented on Atom.io.

### Installing

### OS X

Download the latest [Atom release](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/latest).

Atom will automatically update when a new release is available.

### Windows

Download the latest [AtomSetup.exe installer](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/latest).

Atom will automatically update when a new release is available.

You can also download an `atom-windows.zip` file from the [releases page](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/latest).
The `.zip` version will not automatically update.


### Debian Linux (Ubuntu)

Currently only a 64-bit version is available.

1. Download `atom-amd64.deb` from the [Atom releases page](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/latest).
2. Run `sudo dpkg --install atom-amd64.deb` on the downloaded package.
3. Launch Atom using the installed `atom` command.

The Linux version does not currently automatically update so you will need to
repeat these steps to upgrade to future releases.
